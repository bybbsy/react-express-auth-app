## ExpressJS server
### Authentication and authorization
I used Bearer Authentication method with access and refresh tokens. Both tokens are generated by different secret key.

User receives both tokens on sign-in, sign-up, refresh actions.

### Database
I used [MonogoDB]() and [mongoose]() to store user data, tokens and cards.

### Summary:
- I Implemented tow middlewares:
    - [auth-middleware](https://github.com/bybbsy/vue-express-auth-app/blob/master/server/middleware/auth-middleware.js) - for token verfication
    - [error-handler](https://github.com/bybbsy/vue-express-auth-app/blob/master/server/middleware/error-handler.js) - for error handling
- There are the next models:
    - [Card](https://github.com/bybbsy/vue-express-auth-app/blob/master/server/models/card.js)
    - [Error](https://github.com/bybbsy/vue-express-auth-app/blob/master/server/models/error.js)
    - [Token](https://github.com/bybbsy/vue-express-auth-app/blob/master/server/models/token.js)
    - [User](https://github.com/bybbsy/vue-express-auth-app/blob/master/server/models/user.js)
- Routes:
    - auth:
        - /sign-in
        - /sign-up
        - /sign-out
        - /refresh
    - cardList:
        - cards
- I implemented [a token service](https://github.com/bybbsy/vue-express-auth-app/blob/master/server/service/token-service.js) for creating and validating tokens
- I used [Swagger]() to document APIs. See [Swagger branch](https://github.com/bybbsy/vue-express-auth-app/tree/swagger/server)
